### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

#### Architecture
```
Controllers → Services → Repositories → MongoDB
     ↓
   DTOs ← Models → Validation
```

#### Models
- **Chitty**: Main chitty entity with calculated payments
- **Member**: Individual member with lift status
- **MonthlySlip**: Monthly payment slip container
- **PaymentRecord**: Individual payment tracking

#### Features
- **UUID-based IDs**: No ObjectId serialization issues
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Created/updated dates
- **Soft Deletes**: Preserve data integrity
- **Input Validation**: javax.validation annotations
- **Error Handling**: Standardized API responses

### 📊 Business Rules Implemented

1. **One Lift Per Month**: Only one member can lift per chitty per month
2. **Payment Adjustment**: Lifted members pay 25% extra for all remaining months
3. **Dynamic Slips**: Generate slips for any month with current member status
4. **Payment Tracking**: Track payment dates and status
5. **Member Management**: Add/remove members dynamically

### 🧪 Testing & Verification

#### Tested Scenarios
1. ✅ Create chitty with 20 members
2. ✅ Generate monthly slip for month 1
3. ✅ Mark member as lifted (amount changes to 31,250)
4. ✅ Mark payment as paid (timestamp recorded)
5. ✅ Create new chitty with different amount
6. ✅ All CRUD operations working

#### Sample Data Verified
